Brownian Motion Analysis for PHY353L

We calculated the Boltzmann constant by tracking 1.02 micrometer latex beads suspended in water exhibiting Brownian motion with a microscope and a video camera. A total of 97 particles were tracked and the slope of their mean squared distance as a function of time was used to derive Boltzmann's constant by the Einstein fluctuation-dissipation relation. We found Boltzmann's constant to be 1.37 +/- 0.02 * 10^{-23} J/K. See attached Brownian_Motion.pdf for a full report.
